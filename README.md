# KOALA++: Efficient Kalman-Based Optimization of Neural Networks with Gradient-Covariance Products

This repository will host the official implementation of **KOALA++**, a novel optimizer that integrates Kalman filtering principles into first-order optimization. KOALA++ efficiently captures curvature and uncertainty through recursive gradient-covariance products, offering a favorable trade-off between convergence speed, accuracy, and computational cost.

> ðŸ“¢ **Code Coming Soon**: We are actively preparing the official code release. Stay tuned!
